            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What is the Evaluation Registry?</h2>
            <p>The Evaluation Registry is the new home for all Government evaluations. It is a website where all
              planned, live
              and published evaluations conducted or commissioned by Government Departments are registered. Evaluations
              on the
              Registry can be searched and browsed by users looking to learn from previous evaluations of Government
              policies,
              projects and programmes.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2024, the Registry will become mandatory for ministerial Government Departments to use, and will also
              be made
              accessible to the public to search and browse, enabling greater accessibility, accountability and
              transparency for
              citizens.

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why do we need an Evaluation Registry?</h2>
            <p>In its founding plans for the ETF, the Government identified the need to provide a single location for
              evaluations to be found - whether that's planned evaluations, evaluations currently underway, or those
              that are
              complete with findings to report.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Government was not alone in prioritising this. When the National Audit Office (NAO) investigated <a
              class="govuk-link"
              href="https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Evaluating-government-spending.pdf"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">evaluation in Government</a>, they identified transparency and
              publication of evaluation findings as areas needing improvement and called for the 'open by default'
              approach to
              evaluations to be reinforced. The <a class="govuk-link"
                                                   href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/22451/documents/165470/default/"
                                                   target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Public Accounts Committee
              also
              called for</a> a system that would enable the tracking of evaluations, in a recommendation that the <a
              class="govuk-link" href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/28482/documents/171644/default/"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Government accepted</a> and said it would meet via the
              development of
              the Evaluation Registry.
            </p>
            <p>
              All government evaluations should be published and made available to the public by default, as per the <a
              class="govuk-link"
              href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-social-research-publication-protocols"

              from the
              evaluation of policy/delivery initiatives/pilots and trials" should be "made publicly available in
              accordance with

            </p>
            <p>
              However, not enough evaluations or planned evaluations are currently being published, and those that are
              published
              can be difficult to find and compare. The Registry makes it easier than ever before to search and browse
              published
              evaluations, whether you're a project manager looking for evidence to support a new business case or an
              evaluation
              specialist looking to compare research designs.

            <p>At the moment, Government evaluation plans are rarely published on GOV.UK. However, the GSR Publication
              Protocol
              states that "Departments should make high level information publicly available on all research and
              analysis
              commissioned externally, and internal research where there is an intention to publish. Announcements
              should be
              made as early as is practicable". Please refer to the <a class="govuk-link"

              To register a planned evaluation on the Registry, all you need to do is complete the minimum required
              fields on
              the site which outline the proposed evaluation type, methods, and planned publication date. This
              demonstrates a
              public commitment to evaluating the intervention in question. There is no requirement to upload an
              evaluation plan
              or framework in a document format. Entries for planned evaluations should be updated to include the
              findings and
              report/s from the evaluation once available.
