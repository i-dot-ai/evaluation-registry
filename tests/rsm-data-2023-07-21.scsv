and in telford the works were linked to major multimillion pound investment in the retail centre which attracted significant media coverage. in both telford and redhill, lstf-funded changes within the town centre were generally viewed positively \u2013 more so in telford (where the physical changes to the environment were substantial and very visible) than in redhill (where investment comprised a more balanced mix of capital and revenue initiatives). however, there is no evidence to suggest that corridor-based initiatives in redhill1 had a stronger impact on perceptions in the northern corridor (where most of the corridor-based initiatives were focused), compared with elsewhere in redhill. this may reflect the focus on capital works in the town centre, and the postponement of the london road cycle scheme2 which also meant that corridor-focused marketing and promotion initiatives were delivered on a smaller scale than anticipated. the corridor improvements were less visible than those in town centre locations and less disruptive during the construction period; and the size of the population impacted much smaller. in terms of understanding the impact of lstf interventions on actual travel behaviour, it is important to understand how these positive perceptions influenced perceptions about general levels of accessibility relating to the whole journey. looking at this issue, the results were more mixed and do not fully reflect the positive lstf-related perceptions - although there was some evidence of improved perceptions regarding: \u2022 walking in both locations (with the % describing access as \u2018easy\u2019 increasing by up to 12 percentage points in telford and 8 percentage points in redhill between the before and after surveys); and \u2022 cycling in telford (with the % describing access as \u2018easy\u2019 increasing by up to 17 percentage points). poor perceptions of whole journey accessibility by sustainable modes and lack of familiarity with the options available, along with deficiencies in the wider networks, are likely to continue to be a barrier to increased use of these modes. b. change in travel behaviour and use of sustainable modes it is often suggested that relatively modest investments designed to improve the attractiveness of walking and cycling can have a significant impact on mode split. these results did not find support for this conclusion, at least over the short term (six month) and in these circumstances. the above section shows that improvements in perceptions of general whole journey accessibility are primarily confined to an increase in the % describing access by walking as \u2018easy\u2019 or \u2018very easy\u2019 of up to 12 percentage points in telford and 8 percentage points in redhill. the impact on mode use is therefore likely to be small. the study finds no evidence that a significant proportion of survey respondents wholly transferred to non-car modes, or that a higher proportion were using sustainable modes, six months post implementation. in telford, the box road changes were perceived to have made it quicker and easier to drive to town centre destinations, and this appears to have encouraged a broader proportion of visitors from within telford and beyond, to drive. similarly, at the time of the after surveys, redhill appeared to be attracting new visitors who saw the town centre as a more attractive destination than previously, but may have been less familiar with the environment and transport options available and therefore more likely to travel by car. nevertheless, survey evidence shows net increases in frequency of use of bus, train, and especially walking, amongst users of these modes - as well as increased car use. the results for both locations also show that the biggest change was in the frequency of walking trips; which is consistent with the small improvement in perceptions regarding access by foot, identified above. the extent to which the reported increases in use was because respondents were making more trips, or because they had changed modes for some trips, is unclear, but is likely to have been due to a combination of these factors. there is evidence that some of this change can be attributed to lstf investment. regression analysis undertaken for both case studies shows that: \u2022 those who perceived lstf interventions to have had a positive impact on town centre accessibility (across all modes, including car) were more likely to have reported using sustainable modes more often as a result of the recent transport investment; and \u2022 those who perceived the changes to have been more effective in delivering the intended outcomes were more likely to have reported using sustainable modes more often as a result of the recent transport investment. however, there is no evidence to suggest that additional investment in the northern corridor led to greater use of sustainable modes than elsewhere in redhill. these results are consistent with those of a recent study to evaluate the effects of the connect23 initiative, which measured the impact of new infrastructure at 79 sites across the uk, on walking, cycling, and physical activity levels. the study found that infrastructure interventions may increase walking and cycling (i.e. frequency of use) when delivered in high \u2018doses\u2019; but smaller interventions may be used without necessarily increasing total activity. lack of continuity, segregation, consistency and legibility are all factors which effectively reduce the effectiveness of the intervention, and hence the scale of the likely benefits. in redhill, one key investment in the northern corridor had not taken place at the time of the after survey, and this is expected to have reduced the effectiveness of the lstf package and limited the potential for mode shift (and the value of the counterfactual analysis). in both locations there were also a range of factors within the town centre which appear to have reduced the effectiveness of the walking and cycling infrastructure. residents and town centre users in both towns indicated that the changes to the network have generally improved the flow of vehicles and made it more attractive to drive to the centre; while in telford a new 600 space multi-storey car park opened in may 2014, associated with the new shopping centre \u2013 encouraging more travel from further afield by car. the results suggest that in order to achieve significant mode shift in the short-term, a stronger emphasis on improvement along the corridors in question, increased awareness of the benefits of these routes for walking and cycling, and substantial demand management was probably required. finally, for this study, the after surveys were undertaken six months post implementation (reflecting the funding timescale for the study), and did not allow time for habits to be broken and behaviour changes to evolve over time. c(i). perceptions regarding the attractiveness of the town centre as a retail, service and leisure destination, and frequency of visits. in both locations, transport and environment changes in the town centre were identified by at least half of survey respondents, as having helped promote the town centre as a destination. however, in both cases, this factor was secondary to wider investment in the leisure offering within the town centre - the southwater development and town park improvements in telford and the memorial park in redhill. in telford, there was some evidence that users of all modes were making more frequent journeys, and more visitors were travelling from further afield. this was in contrast to a stagnant or declining trend in the preceding years. lstf investment appears to have played a role in this, although improvements in the retail and leisure offering appear to have been the main cause. in redhill, the lstf investment appears to have encouraged some visitors to make more trips \u2013 \u2018improvement in ease of travelling into the town centre\u2019 was identified as a key reason by 26% of town centre users visiting more frequently. however; it is unclear whether frequency increased overall. this is probably because the scale of investment was much smaller than in telford, the visible transformation less apparent, and there had not yet been a similar step change in the retail / leisure offering \u2013 if anything, it appears to have continued to deteriorate. the research has not identified any causal link between mode use and length of stay. c(ii). economic impacts in both locations, the lstf and associated investment was believed to have had a positive impact on the retail economy, in the short-term \u2013 more so in telford (where the changes are more visible and were delivered at the same time as a major leisure development). in telford, the role of the lstf investment in improving the quality of the town centre environment and perceptions about accessibility was very much part of the mix of factors driving retail confidence and growth in the town centre;

and in telford the works were linked to major multimillion pound investment in the retail centre which attracted significant media coverage. in both telford and redhill, lstf-funded changes within the town centre were generally viewed positively \u2013 more so in telford (where the physical changes to the environment were substantial and very visible) than in redhill (where investment comprised a more balanced mix of capital and revenue initiatives). however, there is no evidence to suggest that corridor-based initiatives in redhill1 had a stronger impact on perceptions in the northern corridor (where most of the corridor-based initiatives were focused), compared with elsewhere in redhill. this may reflect the focus on capital works in the town centre, and the postponement of the london road cycle scheme2 which also meant that corridor-focused marketing and promotion initiatives were delivered on a smaller scale than anticipated. the corridor improvements were less visible than those in town centre locations and less disruptive during the construction period; and the size of the population impacted much smaller. in terms of understanding the impact of lstf interventions on actual travel behaviour, it is important to understand how these positive perceptions influenced perceptions about general levels of accessibility relating to the whole journey. looking at this issue, the results were more mixed and do not fully reflect the positive lstf-related perceptions - although there was some evidence of improved perceptions regarding: \u2022 walking in both locations (with the % describing access as \u2018easy\u2019 increasing by up to 12 percentage points in telford and 8 percentage points in redhill between the before and after surveys); and \u2022 cycling in telford (with the % describing access as \u2018easy\u2019 increasing by up to 17 percentage points). poor perceptions of whole journey accessibility by sustainable modes and lack of familiarity with the options available, along with deficiencies in the wider networks, are likely to continue to be a barrier to increased use of these modes. b. change in travel behaviour and use of sustainable modes it is often suggested that relatively modest investments designed to improve the attractiveness of walking and cycling can have a significant impact on mode split. these results did not find support for this conclusion, at least over the short term (six month) and in these circumstances. the above section shows that improvements in perceptions of general whole journey accessibility are primarily confined to an increase in the % describing access by walking as \u2018easy\u2019 or \u2018very easy\u2019 of up to 12 percentage points in telford and 8 percentage points in redhill. the impact on mode use is therefore likely to be small. the study finds no evidence that a significant proportion of survey respondents wholly transferred to non-car modes, or that a higher proportion were using sustainable modes, six months post implementation. in telford, the box road changes were perceived to have made it quicker and easier to drive to town centre destinations, and this appears to have encouraged a broader proportion of visitors from within telford and beyond, to drive. similarly, at the time of the after surveys, redhill appeared to be attracting new visitors who saw the town centre as a more attractive destination than previously, but may have been less familiar with the environment and transport options available and therefore more likely to travel by car. nevertheless, survey evidence shows net increases in frequency of use of bus, train, and especially walking, amongst users of these modes - as well as increased car use. the results for both locations also show that the biggest change was in the frequency of walking trips; which is consistent with the small improvement in perceptions regarding access by foot, identified above. the extent to which the reported increases in use was because respondents were making more trips, or because they had changed modes for some trips, is unclear, but is likely to have been due to a combination of these factors. there is evidence that some of this change can be attributed to lstf investment. regression analysis undertaken for both case studies shows that: \u2022 those who perceived lstf interventions to have had a positive impact on town centre accessibility (across all modes, including car) were more likely to have reported using sustainable modes more often as a result of the recent transport investment; and \u2022 those who perceived the changes to have been more effective in delivering the intended outcomes were more likely to have reported using sustainable modes more often as a result of the recent transport investment. however, there is no evidence to suggest that additional investment in the northern corridor led to greater use of sustainable modes than elsewhere in redhill. these results are consistent with those of a recent study to evaluate the effects of the connect23 initiative, which measured the impact of new infrastructure at 79 sites across the uk, on walking, cycling, and physical activity levels. the study found that infrastructure interventions may increase walking and cycling (i.e. frequency of use) when delivered in high \u2018doses\u2019; but smaller interventions may be used without necessarily increasing total activity. lack of continuity, segregation, consistency and legibility are all factors which effectively reduce the effectiveness of the intervention, and hence the scale of the likely benefits. in redhill, one key investment in the northern corridor had not taken place at the time of the after survey, and this is expected to have reduced the effectiveness of the lstf package and limited the potential for mode shift (and the value of the counterfactual analysis). in both locations there were also a range of factors within the town centre which appear to have reduced the effectiveness of the walking and cycling infrastructure. residents and town centre users in both towns indicated that the changes to the network have generally improved the flow of vehicles and made it more attractive to drive to the centre; while in telford a new 600 space multi-storey car park opened in may 2014, associated with the new shopping centre \u2013 encouraging more travel from further afield by car. the results suggest that in order to achieve significant mode shift in the short-term, a stronger emphasis on improvement along the corridors in question, increased awareness of the benefits of these routes for walking and cycling, and substantial demand management was probably required. finally, for this study, the after surveys were undertaken six months post implementation (reflecting the funding timescale for the study), and did not allow time for habits to be broken and behaviour changes to evolve over time. c(i). perceptions regarding the attractiveness of the town centre as a retail, service and leisure destination, and frequency of visits. in both locations, transport and environment changes in the town centre were identified by at least half of survey respondents, as having helped promote the town centre as a destination. however, in both cases, this factor was secondary to wider investment in the leisure offering within the town centre - the southwater development and town park improvements in telford and the memorial park in redhill. in telford, there was some evidence that users of all modes were making more frequent journeys, and more visitors were travelling from further afield. this was in contrast to a stagnant or declining trend in the preceding years. lstf investment appears to have played a role in this, although improvements in the retail and leisure offering appear to have been the main cause. in redhill, the lstf investment appears to have encouraged some visitors to make more trips \u2013 \u2018improvement in ease of travelling into the town centre\u2019 was identified as a key reason by 26% of town centre users visiting more frequently. however; it is unclear whether frequency increased overall. this is probably because the scale of investment was much smaller than in telford, the visible transformation less apparent, and there had not yet been a similar step change in the retail / leisure offering \u2013 if anything, it appears to have continued to deteriorate. the research has not identified any causal link between mode use and length of stay. c(ii). economic impacts in both locations, the lstf and associated investment was believed to have had a positive impact on the retail economy, in the short-term \u2013 more so in telford (where the changes are more visible and were delivered at the same time as a major leisure development). in telford, the role of the lstf investment in improving the quality of the town centre environment and perceptions about accessibility was very much part of the mix of factors driving retail confidence and growth in the town centre; and was identified as an important enabler of recent and planned retail / leisure development. the infrastructure improvements are expected to become more important as new developments are completed - in terms of providing sustainable access and creating a more conventional and integrated town centre. in redhill, retailers were less able to identify short-term tangible benefits of the lstf investment, but the dominant view was that the retail economy would be worse if the investment hadn't taken place. in addition, the investment of government funding in the town, along with visible changes on the ground, was felt to have sent a positive message to developers and provided reassurance that redhill is the right place to invest. the real benefits for the economy are expected to be realised over time.", null, null, null, null, "Information not easily found within the report", null, null, null
